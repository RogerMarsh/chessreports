Results database for chess games
================================

.. contents::


Description
===========

Store results of chess games from events such as tournaments and leagues.

Results can be typed in; or extracted from emails or their text, csv, pdf, or spreadsheet attachments.

League fixture lists are used to point out missing or surplus match reports.  Duplicate consistent match reports are treated as a single match report. 

Identify players by saying 'player A in event B' is same as 'player C in event D' and so on.

Allow `English Chess Federation`_ (ECF) grading codes to be associated with identified players and prepare results for submission to ECF for grading.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Use `Python`_ 3.4 or later.

The following should be installed to support extraction of results from pdf and spreadsheet attachments.

* `Xpdf`_, specifically the `pdftotext`_ utility to handle pdf.
* `Gnumeric`_, specifically the ssconvert utility in the `download`_ to handle spreadsheets.

Sometimes it is possible to use `pdfminer3k`_ instead of pdftotext; and `xlsx2csv`_ instead of ssconvert.

Open Document Format (ods) and Office Open XML (xlsx) attachments can be handled without Gnumeric or xlsx2csv.

You will need to install `tnefparse`_ to support extraction of new grading codes from `ECF`_ feedback emails, or results from emails, if the MIME type of the attachment is application/ms-tnef (the filename is usually winmail.dat).


Database Interfaces
===================

The default database interface is the sqlite3 module distributed with Python.

The `apsw`_ interface, if installed, to Sqlite 3 is used instead of the sqlite3 interface.

New databases are accessed using these alternative interfaces if installed.

* `bsddb3`_
* `dptdb`_ (Microsoft Windows only)

If both alternatives are installed, results will use dptdb.

If bsddb3 is used, a version of `Berkeley DB`_ supported by bsddb3 must be installed.


Run
===

The instructions refer to results_lite which does not use data published by the `ECF`_.  The other options are described in `Notes`_.

The command to run this package is:

   python -m chessresults.results_lite

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m chessresults.results_lite

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python -m chessresults.results_lite

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m chessresults.results_lite

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting results_lite.

At least one database engine supported by the `solentware-base`_ package must be installed.


Restrictions
============

At time of writing, February 2015, `Gnumeric`_ do not provide installers for Microsoft Windows.  According to the website, provision ceased in August 2014.


Notes
=====

The results package aims to support the collection and reporting of chess game results to the ECF for grading and statistical analysis of the collected results.

The core features of this package are available in results_lite which supports the collection of game results by event and the identification of games played by a player.

It is difficult to stray far from the style:

28 Januray 2015 J Smith 1 0 P Jones

when typing results one per line, or row in csv and spreadsheets, with

J Smith 1 P Jones 0 28 Januray 2015

and similar not straying too far.  Otherwise you may have to figure some regular expressions to put in the configuration file for the event: avoid having to do this if at all possible.

If the csv or spreadsheet file splits the components of a result into columns you will have to say how to stitch the columns together in the configuration file.

results_ecf adds tools for graders who submit results to the ECF for grading.

results_ogd supports associating these players with their ECF grading codes as published in the Online Grading Database `downloads page`_.

Two tools are provided to assist when importing data.

* identity is the tool used to say which game results belong to the same player when transferring data between databases created by this package.

* prepare_ecf_format and prepare_league_format are tools for transferring data from sources other than databases created by this package.

ECF grading codes are not passed to the importing database even if these are available in the exporting database.
