"""Provide bsddb style access to a list of DPT record sets and lists.

Each record set in the list is displayed in record number order but the
records will not appear in an obvious sort order like alphabetical.  There
will be an application specific reason for the list of record sets to be in
the given order.

Typical use is:
Find the records that match each of the forenames initials and surname in a
given name.  Build sets that match as many as possible of the name elements
and display the reords with those that match most at start.

See www.dptoolkit.com for details of DPT.
