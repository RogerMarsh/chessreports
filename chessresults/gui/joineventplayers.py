"""Display detail of name's involvement in earlier editions of event.

A player is likely referred to using the same name from year to year in an
event.  An ECF grading code will have been used to report the results for
grading.

The option to merge the name from the current event with the earlier editions
is offered, which will cause the same ECF grading code to be used to report
results for the current event.
