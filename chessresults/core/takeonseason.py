"""Take-on data from prepared ECF submission files and League database dumps.

This module does not process valid ECF submission files (2006 definition).

Preparation consists of removing grading code and club data in particular and
any other data that this database does not want or want from these sources.

The data is assumed to be correct.  However team names need to be derived from
the MATCH RESULTS fields but it is not always possible to do this correctly
because there is no prior list of valid team names.  Given reasonable team
names the players involved can be identified as 'AN Other who played for
Anytown in the 2002 Homecounty league' and so on.  Typically AN Other will
have several entries (one for each season's league) and these entries can be
assumed to refer to the same player if the PIN fields have the same value.

The data can be processed with the assumption that equality of PIN value in
different files means it is the same player or with the assumption that it is
not the same player.
