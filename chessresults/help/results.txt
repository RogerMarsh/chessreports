A number of parameters to control the extraction of chess results are added to those provided by EmailExtract to extract text from emails.  These are held in the configuration file maintained by EmailExtract.

The 'Sources | Result extraction' menu option is used to maintain this configuration file.  See 'Help | Text extraction'for the parameters provided by
EmailExtract.


A file, called 'textentry' by default, is provided in the extracted directory for text not supplied via emails.  The default is overridden using the textentry line.

This file holds two versions of the text: the initial empty file, and one with the current content.

textentry textentry


The sched_* parameters describe how to get fixture list data from a csv file or spreadsheet sheet.

The sched_csv_data_name line says get the information from sheet1 of a spreadsheet and create a line of text with the items in the order shown separated by spaces.

The other lines say which column of sheet1 provides the data, by number or name.

sched_csv_data_name sheet1 sched_day sched_date sched_section sched_home_team sched_away_team
sched_date 1
sched_day 0
sched_section 4
sched_home_team 2
sched_away_team 3

An alternative way of specifying the fixture list extract is:

sched_csv_data_name sheet1 sched_data_columns
sched_data_columns 1+0+4+2+3


The report_* parameters describe how to get game result data from a csv file or spreadsheet sheet.

report_csv_data_name and report_data_columns are similar to the similarely named sched_* parameters.

The other report_* paramaters are:

report_date
report_day
report_section
report_home_team
report_away_team
report_home_player
report_away_player
report_result
report_board
report_round
report_home_player_colour
report_away_team_score
report_home_team_score
report_event

Only the ones relevant to a particular case are used.  A collection of results might be reported in a spreadsheet giving just the date, player names, and result.  For example, sheet name Games, and DATE, WHITE, RESULT, and BLACK, as column names:

report_csv_data_name games report_date report_home_player report_result report_away_player
report_date DATE
report_home_player WHITE
report_result RESULT
report_away_player BLACK


Name the competitions in the event.  Some examples:

competition Division 1
competition Open
competition Club Championship


Sometimes team names on fixture list are slightly different from team names in match reports.  One league emphasises where a team plays in the fixture list, but emphasises the rank of the team within the club in result reports, by using different names.

team_name :chi @ bognor:Chichester C


Match results might be reported something like (a variation on the format used before the introduction of a website):

Michael Pope has submitted a scorecard for the Division Three match Chandlers Ford A v Salisbury B.

Chandlers Ford A 1 - 4 Salisbury B, 03/10/2017
1. David J Holmes 1/2 David Renham; 2. Graham Stuart 1/2 Rob McClatchey; 3. Richard J Meredith 0 - 1 Tomas Rusin; 4. Manoj Chandar 0 - 1 John B Symons; 5. Sam J Murphy 0 - 1 Amanda Jones; 

Go to http://www.sotonchessleague.org.uk/Scorecard/61 to view the scorecard.

Regards,
SCL Team

rather than scorecard format something like:

Division Three
Chandlers Ford A 1 - 4 Salisbury B
03/10/2017
1. David J Holmes 1/2 David Renham
2. Graham Stuart 1/2 Rob McClatchey
3. Richard J Meredith 0 - 1 Tomas Rusin
4. Manoj Chandar 0 - 1 John B Symons
5. Sam J Murphy 0 - 1 Amanda Jones

The scorecard format can be extracted without needing to say anything more in the configuration file, but the alternative needs some regular expressions to be defined using some of the parameters listed here:

results_prefix
section_prefix
section_body
match_body
teams_body
games_body
finished
unfinished
default
match_default
match_date_body
played_on_body
teams_played_on_body
games_played_on_body
finished_played_on
unfinished_played_on
match_date_played_on_body
schedule_body
fixture_body
keep_word_splitters
source
drop_forwarded_markers

The regular expressions which deal with the example are given without further comment (except to say avoid using regular expressions if possible):

results_prefix \s+has\s+submitted\s+a\s+scorecard\s+for\s+the\s+
keep_word_splitters -,.'()/;
drop_forwarded_markers >

The section_name parameter links the competition name used in match reports with the name used in, or derived from, the fixture list.
