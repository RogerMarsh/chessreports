Sources Menu

Select emails and extract text into documents.  Also quit program.


Documents Menu

Open and close documents.

Validate documents and apply the results to a database if one is open.

Documents can be edited to make corrections to all details: games, player names, and so forth.  The corrections are made to the database by re-applying the document to the database.

The Edit section under Tab navigation lists the actions available.

The Take On menu item handles results prepared by the prepare_ecf_format and prepare_league_format programs.  It is a specialized Open.


Results Menu

Open, create, and delete results databases.

All actions on the tabs available under the results menu, everything except Edit, are related to recording decisions about who played a set of games and telling interested parties, such as the ECF, the results of these games.

These actions are listed in the sections, except Edit, under Tab navigation.

The Import Events action on the Administration tab processes files generated using the Export Events action on the Events tab.  It may ask that the identify program be used to resolve some player identities.


Buttons

The buttons just below the menu bar emulate a tabbed notebook (for example like the preference editor in most browsers).  (This user interface was built before Tk8.5 became available making tabbed notebook a standard feature.)

The buttons at the bottom of a tab are the actions specific to the tab.  An action such as 'Close' appears on several tabs, but the thing being closed is different.


Popup menus

These appear by right-click when the pointer location makes a choice of actions relevant.

On the tabs controlled by the Results menu highlighting a line yellow is a sign that a popup menu is available.

On the tabs controlled by the Documents menu right-click scrolls one of the other panes in the tab to a relevant position if one can be determined.

On the windows created by the Sources menu items right-click usually scrolls one of the other panes in the window to a relevant position if one can be determined, but may ask for confirmation of an action instead.
